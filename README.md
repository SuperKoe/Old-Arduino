I have made some stuff back around 2008-2010, and all the links and files are lost.
So I am reuploading them here for archiving.

Projects:

- I made the Atmel AT90CAN128 core work with Arduino (v0018).
  We used this chip at my school (NHL) they had their own development boards.

- Made attiny84 work with Arduino. i used this chip to make a Lego PF receiver to make a servo motor work.
  Also attempted to make a bootloader of 0.5 KB in size in ASM, so you could upload with softserial (ATtiny84 doesn't have hardware serial).

- Lego Power Functions. I made libraries for sending and receiving PF
